I love working on cool things with cool people, and I always enjoy a challenge, whether that's architecting new web services or trying to solve a difficult anagram in pub trivia. When I'm not writing software, I'm probably messing around with hardware. I spend my time building and collecting mechanical keyboards, experimenting with IOT and home automation, and finding excuses to model and 3D print gadgets for around the house. Ask me about [what I'm typing on](./static/keyboard.jpg), my dog [Mayzie](./static/mayzie.jpg), or the current state of Longhorn football.",
